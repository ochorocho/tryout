#
# Everything runs here, where there is a TTY and therefore gum: the verbs prompt
# with their own ask_* helpers rather than this script reimplementing any of them.
# The popup is session-modal, so a long verb does hold the session until it is
# done — accepted deliberately, because the alternative left a stray pane behind
# after every run.
#
# The panel is opened per project but this script is reached through a globally
# registered plugin action, so the project is resolved from the CWD, not from $0.
