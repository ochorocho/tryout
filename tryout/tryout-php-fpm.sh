#!/usr/bin/env bash
#ddev-generated

# Runs INSIDE the web container, launched by a web_extra_daemons entry that
# .ddev/config.worktrees.yaml declares (DDEV supervises and restarts it).
#
# Starts an additional php-fpm master for one PHP version on its own socket, so
# per-site vhosts can route to a different PHP than the project default.
#
# Usage: tryout-php-fpm.sh <php-version>        e.g. 8.2
#
# Two constraints, both established by experiment:
#   * The version's stock `www` pool must NOT be loaded — it listens on the shared
#     /run/php-fpm.sock and the second master then dies with
#     "Another FPM instance seems to already listen on /run/php-fpm.sock".
#     So we generate a config that includes only our own pool.
#   * `listen` is a pool directive, so it cannot be passed via `php-fpm -d`.
# Everything under /etc and /run is ephemeral across `ddev restart`, hence the
# config is regenerated on every launch.
