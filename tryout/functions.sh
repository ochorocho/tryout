# Payload version. `ddev add-on get` copies these files once and never refreshes
# them, so a project installed before a change keeps the old command and the old
# completion script — which still work, but offer the previous feature set. That
# is indistinguishable from a broken install, so the number is stamped into
# .ddev/tryout/.version at install time and cmd_status compares the two.
#
# BUMP THIS whenever a change alters what a user sees: a new verb, a new flag, a
# new completion candidate. It is a plain integer because nothing at install time
# can read git — a local `ddev add-on get <dir>` records no version of its own.

# --- gum-backed presentation ------------------------------------------------
# gum (https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum) is OPTIONAL and host-only: the
# container never has it. Everything goes through these wrappers rather than
# calling gum directly, because two of its behaviours have to be handled in ONE
# place:
#
#   1. `gum choose` and friends need a controlling terminal. Without one they
#      print "could not open TTY" AND EXIT 0 — so the exit code lies, and the
#      output is the only reliable signal.
#   2. `gum spin` writes escape sequences when its stdout is not a terminal, so
#      it must never wrap a command whose output is captured.
